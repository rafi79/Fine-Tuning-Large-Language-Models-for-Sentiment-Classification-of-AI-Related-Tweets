Sentiment analysis on financial and economic information is highly relevant for businesses for several key reasons, ranging from market insights (gain valuable insights into market trends, investor confidence, and consumer behavior) to risk management (identifying potential reputational risks) to investment decisions (gauging the sentiment of stakeholders, investors, and the general public businesses can assess the potential success of various investment opportunities).\n\nBefore the technicalities of fine-tuning a large language model like Phi-3, we had to find the correct dataset to demonstrate the potentialities of fine-tuning.\n\nParticularly within the realm of finance and economic texts, annotated datasets are notably rare, with many being exclusively reserved for proprietary purposes. To address the issue of insufficient training data, scholars from the Aalto University School\nof Business introduced in 2014 a set of approximately 5000 sentences. This collection aimed to establish human-annotated benchmarks, serving as a standard for evaluating alternative modeling techniques. The involved annotators (16 people with\nadequate background knowledge on financial markets) were instructed to assess the sentences solely from the perspective of an investor, evaluating whether the news potentially holds a positive, negative, or neutral impact on the stock price.\n\nThe FinancialPhraseBank dataset is a comprehensive collection that captures the sentiments of financial news headlines from the viewpoint of a retail investor. Comprising two key columns, namely \"Sentiment\" and \"News Headline,\" the dataset effectively classifies sentiments as either negative, neutral, or positive. This structured dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing and understanding the complex dynamics of sentiment in the domain of financial news. It has been used in various studies and research initiatives, since its inception in the work by Malo, P., Sinha, A., Korhonen, P., Wallenius, J., and Takala, P.  \"Good debt or bad debt: Detecting semantic orientations in economic texts.\", published in the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology in 2014.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a first step, we install the specific libraries necessary to make this example work.\n\n* accelerate is a distributed training library for PyTorch by HuggingFace. It allows you to train your models on multiple GPUs or CPUs in parallel (distributed configurations), which can significantly speed up training in presence of multiple GPUs (we won't use it in our example).\n* peft is a Python library by HuggingFace for efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters. PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs.\n* bitsandbytes by Tim Dettmers, is a lightweight wrapper around CUDA custom functions, in particular 8-bit optimizers, matrix multiplication (LLM.int8()), and quantization functions. It allows to run models stored in 4-bit precision: while 4-bit bitsandbytes stores weights in 4-bits, the computation still happens in 16 or 32-bit and here any combination can be chosen (float16, bfloat16, float32, and so on).\n* transformers is a Python library for natural language processing (NLP). It provides a number of pre-trained models for NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and machine translation.\n* trl is a full stack library by HuggingFace providing a set of tools to train transformer language models with Reinforcement Learning, from the Supervised Fine-tuning step (SFT), Reward Modeling step (RM) to the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) step.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -q -U torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117\n!pip install -q -U -i https://pypi.org/simple/ bitsandbytes\n!pip install -q -U transformers==\"4.40.0\"\n!pip install -q -U accelerate\n!pip install -q -U datasets\n!pip install -q -U trl\n!pip install -q -U peft\n!pip install -q -U tensorboard\n!pip install -q -U einops","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-03T10:05:38.011885Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-03T10:05:38.012480Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-03T10:07:55.753128Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-03T10:05:38.012434Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-03T10:07:55.751928Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[31mERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.

For each news headline in the test DataFrame:\n    * Create a prompt for the language model, which asks it to analyze the sentiment of the news headline and return the corresponding sentiment label.\n    * Use the pipeline() function from the Hugging Face Transformers library to generate text from the language model, using the prompt.\n    * Extract the predicted sentiment label from the generated text.\n    * Append the predicted sentiment label to the y_pred list.\n2.

The max_new_tokens argument specifies the maximum number of new tokens to generate. The temperature argument controls the randomness of the generated text. A lower temperature will produce more predictable text, while a higher temperature will produce more creative and unexpected text.\n\nThe if statement checks if the generated text contains the word \"positive\".

We configures and initializes a Simple Fine-tuning Trainer (SFTTrainer) for training a large language model using the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, which should save time as it operates on a reduced number of parameters compared to the model's overall size. The PEFT method focuses on refining a limited set of (additional) model parameters, while keeping the majority of the pre-trained LLM parameters fixed. This significantly reduces both computational and storage expenses. Additionally, this strategy addresses the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, which often occurs during the complete fine-tuning of LLMs.\n\nPEFTConfig:\n\nThe peft_config object specifies the parameters for PEFT.
